# StaggerMeter: A simple WoW AddOn to track Stagger

Detailed description TBD.

## Installation
For now only the manual installation is available.
Copy the StaggerMeter folder into WoW's AddOn folder, then if you are in game, type `/reload`.

## Settings
Type `/smsm` to setup keybind for dragging the Stagger bar, as well as the option to display the incoming percentage damage instead of current Stagger level.

## Contributions & Feedback
Right now I do not accept PRs (the AddOn is still being developed), but that might change in the future.

Any feedback is appreciated, for now please use [my email address](mailto:pragerdom@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20StaggerMeter%20Feedback). 
(will add more contacts later)
